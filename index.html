            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <p>Born in Dallas, Texas on July 13th, 1988, my coming was heralded by a double rainbow the day before
            As a child I focused on exploring nature, understanding the rules that make up social interaction,
            and attempting to be engaged as a student. My parents moved myself and the rest of my family at 10.
            New places and new challenges would highlight my life from there. Unable to truly embrace on field,
            I became a "Zack of all Trades" and followed my heart and head to where to led, college (learning pscycology and history) and then the military
            to fulfill a percieved duty and help those that find themselves injured on the line of duty. Ironically, I was
            injured overseas and sent back for rehabilitation and occupational therapy.. sending me adrift and unable to practice medicine. 
            I recovered, left the military, went back to history studies while practicing clinical medicine for a large corporation.
            This led to stagnat dreams and I left to join a friend's company. That company focused in automation and instilled a desire to learn more about computer science!
